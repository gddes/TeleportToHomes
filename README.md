# TeleportToHomes
## Description
This mod has books that allow the player to learn the spells to teleport to the house of there choice. All houses have a book in different locations, try looking around to find the books. They are often located close to the entrances of the homes or somewhere noticeable.
 
### What stage are you at?
This mod is still early in development. Main thing I want is four packages: Base Game Houses w/ DLC without MCM, Base Game Houses w/ DLC with MCM, All AE Houses including Base Game & DLC without MCM, and All AE Houses including Base Game & DLC with MCM. For the MCM, it will involve seeing if the player has the spells in their spell inventory and giving them the option to either remove or add them. Probably will include an add all or remove all button. 

### Why make this mod?
This mod has been done before and I'm sure they are great mods, but I wanted something that is all encompassing and I know will personally work well after I'm done testing hence this is mod. Hopefully you like all the options I'm trying to make, and I can have a mod I will be proud of. 

### **Package Releases**
Public releases have a special version structure depending on the file the player may want. Starting with the first package release being V1.1.0, the packages will follow an increment of 1, 2, 3, 4 for the first number in the version sequence. For example, on the third package release, you will see v3.1.0. The first number of the version number will increment detailing what package it is for so you can always know what you are getting. On that note here are the version numbers with the package names.


> First Package : Base Game Houses w/ DLC without MCM : V1.X.X

> Second Package : Base Game Houses w/ DLC with MCM : V2.X.X

> Third Package : All AE Houses including Base Game & DLC without MCM : V3.X.X
 
> Fourth Package : All AE Houses including Base Game & DLC with MCM : V4.X.X


### I have an issue with the mod!
Report it to the issues tab, or the nexus mods bug reports section (when the page becomes available). 


### Whats all the stuff below this?
It's a breakdown of what I have left to do, the houses that are already done, and the ones I have left to do. You don't have to pay attention to that if you're not curious.
